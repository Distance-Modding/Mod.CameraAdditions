What this adds:

- The ability to offset the FOV of every camera. You can do this with a slider or with an input
- Lock the FOV of the 3rd-Person camera (Chase Camera) so it does not change during gameplay
- Lock the position of the Chase Camera so it doesn't approach you if it slows down (it will still orbit the player)
- Zoom in and out with an input or slider
- Enable the free camera during gameplay. (This means it gets added to the selectable cameras during gameplay like the cockpit and hood cameras)
- Offset the position all Car Cameras with a slider or input
- Offset the rotation of all Car Cameras with a slider or input
